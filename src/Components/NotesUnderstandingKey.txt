whenever we add a new item to the div we get to see 
in the Chrome Developer Tools that the last item flashes
ie, a new div is created at the very bottom of the list
however in the React interface the new item is added on the top of the list.
So what actually happens is that React renders this last item in the list of divs
and updates all the other items and replaces their content  

Before rendering data on the viewport, React stacks on array after another and updates the content
of these arrays sequentially. However this entire process takes alot of time and the performance
is significantly compromised. We could run after bugs as well.

Therefore to avoid these scenarios we add the KEY item, it essentially helps React understand and specifically distinguish
these HTML divs.

Once we do that the React won't really flash and replace the items anymore.
However it will uniquely distinguish these divs and store in the given way it's entered.
Thereby not creating any form of performance bugs.

The second part of the module deals with conditional content. Conditional content is about rendering 
different content with respect to different programming logic. 

In Javascript, if we use the && operator it returns everything after that && operator.

So if the first condition is met then the control flows to the second condition automatically.
